# Problem:

Throughout history, Colombia has consistently grappled with a drug trafficking issue. This problem has brought violence and poverty, affecting everyone from children to adults. It's a situation that is both familiar, yet strange, to the people.

# Solution:

The project aims to visualize a facet of an issue, presenting its impact in a humorous way. Its objective is to illustrate the problem within a neighborhood context, demonstrating to individuals how close the issue might be without their awareness.
